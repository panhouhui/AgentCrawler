/**
 * Tool privilege classification — fail-closed least-privilege policy.

 * OpenCrow agents ingest untrusted scraped/channel content, so a prompt-injection
 * that reaches the model must NOT be able to reach high-impact primitives (shell,
 * file writes, process control, sub-agent spawn, db writes/reads). This module is
 * the single source of truth for which tools are dangerous and which an agent gets
 * by default.
 *
 * Rules enforced here (see `isToolGranted` / `buildAgentDisallowedNativeTools`):
 *  - HIGH-IMPACT tools are NEVER granted implicitly. Even an agent with
 *    toolFilter.mode === "all" does NOT get them unless they are explicitly
 *    listed in toolFilter.tools.
 *  - ADMIN tools (a subset of high-impact: sub-agent spawn, process
 *    control) are likewise excluded from any implicit grant.
 *  - The default tool filter is a conservative allowlist of read / research /
 *    memory / read-only scraper-and-search tools.

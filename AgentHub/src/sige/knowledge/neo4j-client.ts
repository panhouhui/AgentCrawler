/**
 * neo4j-client.ts — read-only Bolt client over the live mem0 Neo4j graph.
 *
 * Structural sibling of {@link ../knowledge/mem0-client}. It queries the SAME
 * Neo4j instance mem0 writes its graph store to (no ETL, no second copy) to
 * surface bounded multi-hop "opportunity paths" (pain → product → adjacent
 * feature/gap chains) for idea synthesis.
 *
 * Hard safety contract — this is read-only graph traversal over UNTRUSTED,
 * app-store-review-derived data:
 *   - READ-mode sessions only (`session({ defaultAccessMode: READ })` +
 *     `session.executeRead`). The client NEVER issues a write transaction.
 *   - PARAMETERIZED Cypher only. No caller value is ever interpolated into the
 *     query text — every bound value (degree caps, hop count, stoplist regex,
 *     relationship whitelist, userId) travels as a `$param`.
 *   - Per-query transaction `{ timeout }` PLUS a JS `Promise.race` fallback so a
 *     hung Bolt connection can't stall the pipeline past the configured ceiling.
 *   - `opportunityPaths()` NEVER throws — it returns `[]` on any error, on an
 *     open circuit breaker, or on a timeout. The graph is GUIDANCE, never
 *     authoritative, so degrade-to-empty is correct.
 *   - Cycle rejection (a node name appearing twice in a path) is done in the JS
 *     mapper — no APOC dependency on the server.
 *   - Password comes from `getSecret("NEO4J_PASSWORD")` and is NEVER logged.
 *
 * The `neo4j-driver` package is imported LAZILY (only when a query actually
 * runs) so a deployment with the feature OFF never loads it.

 * Each canonicalized edge also keeps an `orig_type` property (reversible).
 *
 * Casing is enforced on BOTH sides now: the mem0 sidecar uppercases relationship
 * types at write (mem0-server/app.py), and this query folds live types to upper
 * before the membership test (`toUpper(type(r)) IN $relWhitelist`), so an
 * un-canonicalized lowercase edge that transiently appears (e.g. from the
 * code-graph ingestion path) is still matched rather than silently dropped. The
 * weekly canonicalizer still owns the deeper synonym/label/orphan consolidation.
 *
 * `TARGETS` carries product → audience-segment signal (e.g. trip_planner →
 * backpackers, correlation_studio → researchers) — directly relevant to matching
 * an opportunity to its user segment, and low-noise. Catch-all/taxonomy types
 * (RELATED_TO, IS_A, DESCRIBED_AS) and noisy ones (CAUSES) are deliberately
 * excluded to keep multi-hop paths clean.

 * bound on top. This MUST be ≥ the config schema's `graphReasoning.maxHops` max
 * (currently 6 — see `src/config/schema.ts`). At ceiling=6 the query runs in
 * tens of ms; the runtime `$maxHops` guard keeps results bounded as configured.

 * that are all same-partition, non-stoplisted, and below the degree cap, then
 * returns the seed name + an ordered step list. EVERY caller value is a $param —
 * no interpolation. `(?i)` makes the stoplist regex case-insensitive server-side.
 *
 * PERFORMANCE — this query is engineered to be INDEX-BACKED and avoid per-node
 * runtime degree subqueries (both were the cause of the original >4min timeout):
 *   - Seed/destination/intermediate nodes are qualified to the `:Entity` base
 *     label (every sige-graph node carries it) so the `entity_user_id` /
 *     `entity_name` property indexes can apply — a bare `{user_id:…}` match has
 *     no label and forces a full node scan (Neo4j property indexes are
 *     label-scoped).
 *   - Degree filtering reads a precomputed `n.degree` property (index
 *     `entity_degree`) instead of evaluating `COUNT { (n)--() }` for every node
 *     on every candidate path. The `:Entity` label, the `degree` property, and
 *     all three indexes are maintained by `scripts/canonicalize-neo4j-graph.py`
 *     (weekly via launchd) and ensured at deploy. `degree` can be transiently
 *     stale between canonicalization runs — acceptable for a guidance-only hub
 *     cap (the only two sige-global nodes over the default cap, app_store /
 *     play_store, are STOPLISTed anyway).
 *   - The variable-length pattern carries a LITERAL upper bound
 *     (`MAX_HOPS_CEILING`); see that constant for why an unbounded `*2..` is

- **Signal grounding**: Which specific data point(s) from the briefing evidence this need? (cite the actual review, post, or trend)
- **First 100 users**: Who exactly are the first users? Be specific — not "developers" but "solo developers building SaaS who currently waste 3+ hours/week on billing integration"
- **Why existing solutions fail**: What do people use today and why is it inadequate? Point to evidence.
- **The wedge**: What is the smallest, most focused version of this product that delivers immediate value?
- **One-line pitch**: A single sentence a user would forward to a colleague: "It's like X but Y"

CRITICAL QUALITY CRITERIA:
- REJECT ideas that are generic enough that anyone could have proposed them without the data
- REJECT ideas that describe a category ("an AI tool for X") rather than a specific product
- REJECT ideas where the first 100 users are vague or undefined
- Every idea must be traceable to a specific signal in the briefing data`,

    2: `## Round 2 — Strategic Interaction

Your task is to **evaluate ideas from Round 1 and propose improvements**.

Apply your reasoning pattern: "${definition.reasoningPattern}"

For each idea:
- Score it 0.0–1.0 from your strategic perspective
- Provide a critique that reflects your role's lens
- Suggest a concrete improvement if warranted

Then propose 1–2 new ideas that build on the best candidates.${contextBlock}`,

    3: `## Round 3 — Evolutionary Tournament

Your task is to **rank competing ideas by fitness and propose mutations/recombinations**.

Apply your reasoning pattern: "${definition.reasoningPattern}"

- Rank all ideas by strategic fitness (0.0–1.0) with explicit reasoning
- Propose 1–2 mutations: take a promising idea and modify one key assumption
- Propose 1 crossover: combine two complementary ideas into a stronger hybrid${contextBlock}`,

    4: `## Round 4 — Equilibrium Analysis

Your task is to **identify strategic equilibria and provide final evaluations**.

Apply your reasoning pattern: "${definition.reasoningPattern}"

- Identify any Nash, Pareto, dominant, or evolutionarily stable strategy configurations
- Produce final scores for all surviving ideas
- Flag unexplored quadrants of strategy space
- Provide meta-observations about the strategic landscape${contextBlock}`,

/**
 * Phase 2 — DEMAND-SIDE GROUNDING (PURE core).
 *
 * The ideas pipeline is supply-side blind: every scraper feeds it WHAT exists
 * (apps, repos, launches, news) but nothing about WHO WANTS IT. As a result the
 * GIANT `demand` axis — which is EVIDENCE-GATED in giant.ts (capped <=2 without
 * a cited artifact) — can never legitimately score 3-5. This module supplies the
 * missing artifact: a structured, CITED {@link DemandArtifact} bound to each
 * candidate, derived DETERMINISTICALLY from real scraped-row COUNTS.
 *
 * CRITICAL ANTI-HALLUCINATION CONTRACT (from the plan's pressure-test):
 *   - Demand keywords are extracted from the candidate's own text by CODE
 *     ({@link extractDemandKeywords}) — tokenize, drop stopwords, keep salient
 *     terms + bigrams. No LLM picks the queries.
 *   - The artifact's `score` / `confidence` / `whitespace` are DETERMINISTIC
 *     functions of the evidence ROW COUNTS ({@link aggregateDemand}). An LLM may
 *     only PHRASE a `quote` that is already present in a matched row; it may
 *     NEVER invent a count or assert demand.
 *   - ABSENCE IS A PENALTY, NOT A NEUTRAL: zero matched evidence yields a LOW
 *     score (<=1) and LOW confidence (<=0.2), never a free middling score.
 *
 * Everything here is PURE (no DB / clock / rng) and fully unit-testable. The
 * DB-reading probes live in ./demand-probes.ts; this module only defines the
 * shapes, the keyword extractor, the deterministic aggregation, and the
 * {@link DemandProbe} interface they implement.

/**
 * outcome-memory.ts — the idea-learning loop's memory layer.
 *
 * After a pipeline run terminally labels its ideas (validated / archived /
 * stored-pending / dedup-rejected), this module distils each verdict into a
 * single natural-language SENTENCE and writes it back to mem0 under a dedicated
 * `sige-ideas` userId. At the next synthesis round those sentences are read back
 * and injected into the generation prompt as semantic GUIDANCE — "reinforce this
 * rigor" / "do not regenerate this pattern" — never as few-shot exemplars.
 *
 * Control-flow (which bucket a memory lands in, reinforce vs avoid) is driven
 * ONLY by the structured Zod metadata on each memory, NEVER by the free-text
 * body. Every body string is sanitizeScrapedField'd AGAIN on read (mem0
 * consolidation can reshape text) and wrapUntrusted before it touches a prompt,
 * because mem0 contents are untrusted by the time they come back.
 *
 * Pure core (toOutcomeMemory / renderOutcomeSentence / buildOutcomeMemoryBlock)
 * has no I/O; writeOutcomeMemories / fetchOutcomeMemoryBlock are best-effort and
 * degrade silently when the mem0 sidecar is down (the client's circuit breaker
 * handles the unavailable case; we log.warn and continue).

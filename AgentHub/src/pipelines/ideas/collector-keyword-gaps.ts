/**
 * Keyword-gap seed collector.
 *
 * Turns high-opportunity App Store keyword gaps (produced by the keyword-gap
 * scanner, persisted in `appstore_keyword_scans`) into SIGNAL seeds for the
 * idea-synthesis pipeline. A `GapSeed` is a bare market signal — a keyword with
 * a whitespace/opportunity score — NOT a pre-formed idea. It is fed to synthesis
 * as Pass-1 context so the generator can invent ideas that address the gap; it
 * is never pushed into the SIGE `extraCandidates` channel (which carries fully
 * formed idea candidates).
 *
 * `selectGapSeeds` is pure and DB-free (unit-tested). `collectKeywordGaps` is a
 * thin DB-backed wrapper that loads the top opportunities, applies the pure
 * selector against the run's consumed-signal set, records the chosen KEYWORDS
 * into `ctx.selected` (so pipeline.ts can mark them consumed), and returns the
 * seeds. All DB work is wrapped so a failure degrades to `[]` and can never
 * break the pipeline.
 *
 * Dedup unit is the KEYWORD, not the scan row id — `getTopOpportunities`
 * returns the newest scan per keyword, so every scan cycle mints a new row id
 * for the same keyword; id-based dedup would let the same keyword re-seed on
 * every run. `GapSeed.sourceId` still carries the scan row id (the
 * audit/whitespace trail); only the consumption/dedup key is the keyword.

 * Dedup unit is the KEYWORD, not the scan row id: `getTopOpportunities` returns
 * the newest scan per keyword, so a new scan cycle mints a fresh row id for the
 * same keyword every time — id-based dedup would let the same keyword re-seed
 * on every run. Consumption still decays over time via the ledger's half-life,
 * so a keyword becomes eligible again once it's no longer freshly consumed.
 *
 * `downweightedKeywords` (Batch F, F5 leg 2/3 — a screener soft-dismissal
 * flag) and `killedWeights` (Batch F, F5 leg 4 — the decayed, accumulated
 * `killed_count` a keyword's exposed pipeline runs earned; see
 * `keyword-verdict-store.ts`'s `getPipelineKilledWeights`) both ONLY affect
 * SORT ORDER, never filtering — a keyword's own `opportunity` field on the
 * returned {@link GapSeed} is always the real measured value, never
 * discounted. The two downweights COMPOSE (a keyword can be both screener-
 * dismissed AND carry an outcome kill signal) via simple multiplication;
 * `killedWeights` uses a graduated `1 / (1 + killedCount * strength)` curve
 * (rather than `downweightedKeywords`'s flat halving) since it is a continuous
 * magnitude, not a boolean flag — a keyword killed across many exposed runs
 * sinks further than one killed once.
 *
 * `opts.buildabilityRankWeight` (2026-07-25) adds a THIRD sort-only modifier:
 * the rank is scaled by `(1 - w) + w * buildability/100`. Rationale — measured
 * over the 20,341 keywords above the seed opportunity threshold, ranking by
 * pure `opportunity` reliably selects keywords whose SERP leader has millions
 * of reviews (`opportunity` never looks at the leader's review count at all:
 * `dispute` scores 0.603 against a 2,673,304-review incumbent), which is
 * exactly the population a solo builder cannot win. `buildability` DOES gate on
 * `top_app_reviews`, so blending it in pushes the selector toward keywords that
 * are both wanted and winnable.
 *
 * It is deliberately a BLEND and not a replacement: sorting by buildability
 * alone is worse than the status quo, because buildability rewards a low review
 * count without requiring real demand — the corpus's buildability leaders are
 * near-zero-demand fragments (`mvshort`, `flsie`, `abpv`). Opportunity supplies
 * the demand signal, buildability supplies the winnability signal, and neither
 * is sufficient alone. As with the other two modifiers, this only ever affects
 * SORT ORDER — a returned {@link GapSeed}'s `opportunity` is always the real
 * measured value.

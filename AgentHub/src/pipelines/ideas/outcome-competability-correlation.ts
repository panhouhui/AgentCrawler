/**
 * outcome-competability-correlation.ts — the LEARNED half of moat scoring.
 *
 * The competability gate (competability.ts) decides "can a small builder win this
 * market?" from STATIC constants and an LLM moat score. This module closes the
 * loop: it correlates those moat signals with REAL idea OUTCOMES that already came
 * back from mem0 (validated vs archived), and distils a small, BOUNDED directive
 * that nudges the next synthesis round — "high-moat ideas pursued here
 * underperformed; low-moat niche ideas validated". So moat preference becomes
 * learned from results, not just the hard-coded thresholds.
 *
 * Everything here is PURE aggregation over the STRUCTURED metadata of memories the
 * caller already fetched — NO new mem0 round-trip, NO LLM call. It reads only the
 * numeric/boolean competability slice on each {@link OutcomeMemory}; it never
 * parses the untrusted body text, and the lines it emits are fixed directive prose
 * built from in-code constants and counts (no scraped/LLM strings), so they need
 * no untrusted fence.
 *
 * Empty / no-competability input → "" so a default run (or a corpus with no scored
 * memories) is byte-identical to the pre-feature path.

 * Build a small BOUNDED moat-learnings directive from retrieved outcomes by

 *
 *   - AVOID line: emitted when {@link MIN_CORRELATION_SAMPLES}+ ARCHIVED ideas
 *     carried high moats — "high-moat ideas pursued here underperformed", naming
 *     the recurring moats.
 *   - REINFORCE line: emitted when {@link MIN_CORRELATION_SAMPLES}+ VALIDATED ideas
 *     were low-moat (wide-open) — "low-moat niche ideas validated well".
 *
 * Each side is gated independently on its own sample floor, so a thin corpus emits
 * at most the line it actually has evidence for (or nothing). The lines are fixed
 * directive prose over in-code constants + counts + the named moat set; no scraped
 * or LLM text reaches the output. Caps are RESPECTED by construction: this emits
 * at most two lines and is APPENDED to the existing REINFORCE/AVOID block which the
 * caller has already de-duped and capped — it does not expand those buckets.
 *
 * Empty input or no competability-scored memories → "" (byte-identical default).
 * PURE — no I/O, no clock, no throw.
 *
 * Phase 2 `goldReprobeOnly` (gated by trustWeighting upstream): when true, the
 * AVOID moat line counts only GOLD (human) + REPROBE (deferred re-probe) archived
 * memories, so same-run proxy self-grades cannot manufacture a moat lesson. Absent
 * / false → counts every archived memory as before (byte-identical default).

/**
 * Trend-intersection idea synthesizer.
 *
 * 3-pass synthesis approach:
 * 1. Intersection Discovery — find 15-20 non-obvious intersection hypotheses
 * 2. Idea Development — develop top 10 hypotheses into full idea candidates
 * 3. Idea Critique — score each idea on specificity, signal grounding,
 *    differentiation, and buildability; kill weak ones
 *
 * Falls back to single-pass synthesis if Pass 1 fails.
 *
 * This module is the PUBLIC ENTRY POINT for the synthesizer. To keep every file
 * under the 800-line ceiling, the retrieval layer (deepSearch + rerankers +
 * signal-ranking) lives in `./synthesizer-retrieval` and the generation layer
 * (prompt builders + JSON parsers + section builders + the three LLM sub-phases)
 * lives in `./synthesizer-generation`. The small pure helpers below stay HERE so
 * the siblings (and external importers) can pull them from "./synthesizer"
 * without a cycle, and both siblings are re-exported so the public API is
 * unchanged.

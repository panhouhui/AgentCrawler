/**
 * `"empty"` is a TERMINAL status distinct from both `"completed"` and

 * `src/pipelines/ideas/zero-yield.ts`). It exists because a zero-yield run used
 * to record `"completed"` and render green — run `2f00f949` (2026-07-19) burned
 * 824,914ms, emitted 0 ideas, and was indistinguishable from a good day. It is
 * NOT `"failed"`, so a genuine crash stays separable from a clean no-op run;
 * `"failed"` remains reserved for thrown errors and reaped runs.
 *
 * There is no CHECK constraint on `pipeline_runs.status`, so no migration is
 * needed to store it. Anything that switches on status must treat `"empty"` as
 * terminal — `findResumableRuns` only looks for `'running'`, so it is already
 * correct by construction.

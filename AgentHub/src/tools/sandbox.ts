/**
 * OS-level sandbox wrapper for shell execution.
 *
 * THREAT: the bash tool (and the dev-tool exec path) run shell commands chosen
 * by an LLM that ingests untrusted scraped content. cwd confinement and string
 * blocklists are trivially bypassable (env ssh, nested sh -c, base64, /dev/tcp).
 * The real boundary is an OS sandbox that restricts the *filesystem* to the
 * allowed directories and disables/filters *network* egress.
 *
 * Mechanisms (detected at runtime):
 *   - macOS:  `sandbox-exec` (Seatbelt) with a generated profile.
 *   - Linux:  `bwrap` (bubblewrap) with bind mounts + `--unshare-net`.
 *
 * Modes come from ToolsConfig.sandbox:
 *   - "off":         never wrap.
 *   - "best-effort": wrap when a mechanism exists; else warn loudly + run raw.
 *   - "required":    fail closed (refuse) when no mechanism exists.
 *
 * This module is PURE w.r.t. execution: it only *builds* an argv (and decides
 * whether to refuse). The caller spawns it. That keeps it composable with the
 * process-group-kill work happening on bash.ts in parallel.

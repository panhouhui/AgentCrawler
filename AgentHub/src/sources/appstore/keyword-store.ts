 * `src/tools/appstore.ts` all admit new corpus rows through here, so enforcing
 * retirement in this one function covers every discovery path at once —
 * nothing has to be duplicated into each miner (and no future miner can forget
 * it). Retirement that only stopped SELECTION would be pointless: the next
 * expansion cycle would re-discover the same brand hints and re-admit them.
 *
 * Two things are refused, both via `keyword-retirement.ts`'s pure family logic:
 *   1. the retired keyword itself (its own token prefix is itself); and
 *   2. any descendant of a retired brand FAMILY ROOT — re-admitting
 *      "spotify premium" the cycle after retiring "spotify" is pointless, since
 *      the whole token family is navigational for one product.
 *
 * `manual`/`seed` rows bypass the guard entirely: a human explicitly asking for
 * a keyword outranks a heuristic retirement, and that is also the documented
 * un-retire path for a false positive.
 *
 * Cost is ONE extra query per call, not per candidate: every candidate's token
 * prefixes are collected and probed in a single indexed `keyword = ANY(...)`
 * primary-key lookup (`getRetiredFamilyRoots`), never a `LIKE 'root %'` scan
 * over the retired set.

 * in `keyword-miner.ts`'s `mineKeywords`, which mines candidate keywords
 * from both pools.
 *
 * `top_apps` is stored DOUBLE-ENCODED: Bun's SQL driver returns the jsonb

 * (written via `JSON.stringify(p.topApps)` in `insertScan`) — so the

 * `(top_apps #>> '{}')::jsonb` un-escapes the outer string to recover the
 * real array before `jsonb_array_elements` can walk it.
 *
 * Defensive by construction rather than by catching a thrown cast error —
 * Postgres has no per-row try/catch in plain SQL, so a single bad cast
 * would abort the whole query and every caller with it. The WHERE clause
 * restricts to rows that are non-null, not the JSON literal `'null'`, AND
 * whose text representation starts with `"[` (the shape of a
 * JSON-encoded-string wrapping an array, checked with `LIKE` rather than a
 * `~` regex — `[` needs no escaping there, sidestepping any
 * JS-string-literal-vs-POSIX-regex escaping mismatch) BEFORE the cast ever
 * runs, so a malformed row is silently skipped instead of blowing up the
 * query.
 *
 * Bounded twice: `scanRowsLimit` caps how many recent scan rows are even
 * considered (freshness + cost bound on a table that grows without end),
 * and `limit` caps the distinct names returned. The final `GROUP BY name
 * ORDER BY max(scanned_at) DESC` (rather than a plain `SELECT DISTINCT ...
 * LIMIT`) matters: a bare `DISTINCT` has no ordering guarantee of its own,
 * so a `LIMIT` stacked directly on it could arbitrarily keep or drop any

 * freshest occurrence makes "freshest names survive the limit first" an

// Pure adaptive-throttle state machine for the keyword-gap sweep's scan rate
// (see `scraper.ts`'s `keywordSweepTick`, `keyword-gaps.ts`'s
// `runKeywordSweep`). Apple's tolerance for request volume — not anything
// under our control — is the real constraint on how fast this sweep can run,
// so this tracks each sweep's rate-limit (429/503) error rate and backs the
// effective rate off automatically when it spikes, recovering gradually once
// errors subside. No I/O, no Date.now() — every input (rates, prior state)
// is caller-supplied, so this is exhaustively unit-testable.
//
// This IS an AIMD (additive-increase/multiplicative-decrease) controller:
// `advanceThrottle` halves the multiplier on a real error-rate spike
// (`THROTTLE_BACKOFF_FACTOR` / `throttleBackoffFactor` config) and, once
// `THROTTLE_HOLD_SWEEPS` consecutive sweeps come back clean, steps it back up
// by `THROTTLE_RECOVERY_STEP` / `throttleRecoveryStep` (config) toward 1.0 —
// repeating until it either reaches the configured rate or trips again. The
// intent (continuous-fetch pass, 2026-07-23, once mined exploration stopped
// being paced by idle sweeps — see keyword-tiering.ts) is for the sustained
// rate to OSCILLATE just under Apple's real ceiling: back off hard on a real
// spike, then keep probing back up rather than staying permanently throttled.
//
// The scraper process holds ONE `ThrottleState` in memory across sweeps
// (like `lastScreenerRunAt` in `scraper.ts`) — process-local, not persisted;
// a restart simply resets to `INITIAL_THROTTLE_STATE`, which is harmless
// (worst case: one sweep's-worth of unthrottled rate before the state machine
// re-detects a real problem).
//
// Reality check on the ceiling this oscillates under (2026-07-23): Apple
// enforces the iTunes JSON endpoints' (search/lookup/review-RSS/hints) per-IP
// burst limit with a bare HTTP 403 (no `Retry-After` — see `ssrf-safe-fetch.ts`
// / `rate-limit-error.ts`'s `treat403AsRateLimit`), NOT 429/503. On a SINGLE
// direct IP that puts the sustainable sweep rate this AIMD loop converges to
// at roughly the ~15,000-35,000 requests/day range (empirically observed —
// varies with time of day / Apple-side load, hence the range, not a fixed
// number). Going meaningfully higher than that requires spreading requests
// across residential proxies, NOT just more aggressive local pacing — the
// `fix/serp-lanes-direct` history already burned this once for datacenter
// proxies (Webshare): datacenter exit IPs get 403'd by Apple same as a single
// direct IP does on burst, so a datacenter proxy pool doesn't actually raise
// the ceiling, only a residential one would.

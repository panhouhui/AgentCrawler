/**
 * Competability decision AUDIT store (migration 028).
 *
 * Persists ONE row per EVALUATED idea — KEPT or KILLED — at the point the
 * competability gate decides, BEFORE ENFORCE mode drops a killed idea. This is
 * the COMPLETE gate population, the cure for the survivor bias that made the
 * calibration backtest meaningless (only ideas that PASSED the gate ever reached
 * `generated_ideas`).
 *
 * Kept in its OWN module (not bolted onto the large `store.ts`) so the audit
 * concern stays focused and small. Both gate sites — the pipeline Pass-3 critique
 * and the SIGE cross-write gate — collect their per-run decisions and FLUSH them
 * here in a single batch insert. The write is BEST-EFFORT: an audit failure must
 * never break idea generation, so the flush swallows + logs and returns 0.

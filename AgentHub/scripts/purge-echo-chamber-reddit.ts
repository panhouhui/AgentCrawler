/**
 * Maintenance script: purge echo-chamber and crypto reddit_posts rows.
 *
 * This is a ONE-TIME cleanup to remove existing rows that were ingested before
 * the denylist was added. After deploy, new scrape cycles will not ingest these
 * subreddits, so this only needs to run once.
 *
 * SAFE TO RUN: uses a DRY_RUN=true default. Pass DRY_RUN=false to execute the
 * DELETE. Always previews row counts first regardless of dry-run mode.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun scripts/purge-echo-chamber-reddit.ts            # dry run (count only)
 *   DRY_RUN=false bun scripts/purge-echo-chamber-reddit.ts  # execute DELETE
 *
 * Expected row counts (as of corpus snapshot 2026-06-21, 5,637 total rows):
 *   Would delete: 3,717 rows (66%)
 *   Remaining:    1,920 rows (end-user/vertical-pain + misc subs)

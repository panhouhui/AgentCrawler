"""
Mem0 sidecar for OpenCrow / SIGE.

Exposes the *hosted-platform-shaped* endpoints that `src/sige/knowledge/mem0-client.ts`
already calls (`/v1/memories/`, `/v1/memories/search/`, …), backed by a self-hosted
mem0 SDK instance wired to:
  - vector store : Qdrant   (existing container)
  - graph store  : Neo4j    (relations — the only thing SIGE reads)
  - embedder     : Ollama   (host-native, nomic-embed-text)
  - extraction   : Ollama   (host-native, via the OpenAI-compatible /v1 endpoint)

This deliberately mirrors the client's request/response contract so no TypeScript
client changes are needed.

Two Memory instances back the ADD path, differing only in whether a graph_store is
configured (same Qdrant collection / embedder / llm otherwise):
  - `_memory`          — graph_store configured → graph extraction ON (SIGE writes).
  - `_memory_nograph`  — no graph_store → graph phase skipped → ~embedding-latency
                         fast (agent-memory writes, the Qdrant→mem0 migration path).
The `enable_graph` flag in ADD request bodies is now HONORED: `enable_graph: false`
routes the write to the graph-less instance; unset/true keeps the graph-on instance
so SIGE's behavior is byte-identical. Reads (search/get_all/delete) always run on
`_memory`; because both instances share the SAME Qdrant collection, graph-less writes
are still returned by the existing search path (scoped by user_id).

# ─── CRITICAL: neutralize mem0's per-call PostHog telemetry (thread leak) ───────
# mem0 0.1.118's `mem0.memory.telemetry.capture_event` constructs a BRAND-NEW
# `AnonymousTelemetry()` on EVERY call, which constructs a brand-new `Posthog`
# client, which starts a daemon `Consumer` thread in its constructor and is never
# `.shutdown()`/`.close()`'d. mem0 calls `capture_event` on every add / search /
# get / _create_memory (per verbatim chunk on infer:false writes), so each write
# permanently leaks ~1 live OS thread. The Consumer's `run()` is `while
# self.running:` and `self.running` only flips on `pause()` (called from
# `shutdown()`), so the thread never exits — a TRUE unbounded leak, not a
# transient spike. Under a high-volume backfill the sidecar's thread count climbs
# monotonically until it hits `ulimit -u` (4000) and the runtime raises
# "can't start new thread", then even /health fails.
#
# `MEM0_TELEMETRY=false` does NOT fix this: that flag only sets
# `posthog.disabled = True`, which gates *sending* — the Consumer thread is still
# started in `Posthog.__init__` regardless (measured: 50 AnonymousTelemetry() with
# MEM0_TELEMETRY=false still leaked 50+ threads). The robust fix is to stop the
# per-call client construction entirely: replace `capture_event` /
# `capture_client_event` with no-ops, and neuter `AnonymousTelemetry` so neither
# the module-level `client_telemetry` singleton nor any stray construction can
# spawn a Posthog Consumer.
#
# This is patched BEFORE `from mem0 import Memory` so that when `mem0.memory.main`
# / `mem0.proxy.main` do `from mem0.memory.telemetry import capture_event` (a
# by-name binding at import time), they bind the no-op. We also overwrite the name
# in already-loaded mem0 namespaces defensively in case import order ever changes.
# Self-hosted OpenCrow has no use for mem0's anonymous usage analytics, so dropping
# them is purely upside. The vector/graph/embedder/LLM paths are untouched — only
# the analytics side-channel is removed.

# ─── CRITICAL: make the Ollama embedder tolerate over-context chunks ────────────
# mem0 0.1.118's `OllamaEmbedding.embed` calls the ollama-python client's LEGACY
# `Client.embeddings(model=..., prompt=text)` → Ollama's deprecated
# `POST /api/embeddings`. That path passes NO `options` and NO `truncate`, and —
# verified against the live sidecar's Ollama — the legacy endpoint IGNORES
# `options.num_ctx` and HARD-ERRORS (HTTP 500 "the input length exceeds the
# context length") whenever a chunk's token count exceeds nomic-embed-text's
# loaded context. nomic's modelfile loads a 2048-token context by default, so
# dense content (reddit/markdown/URL-heavy) blows past it in ~4.5k chars. This
# broke (a) the Qdrant→mem0 backfill (failed mid-run) and (b) every live SIGE /
# agent-memory write of a dense chunk — both embed through this same code path.
#
# mem0 0.1.118 exposes NO config passthrough for `num_ctx`/`truncate`/endpoint
# (the embedder config block only accepts model / ollama_base_url /
# embedding_dims), so this cannot be fixed by config alone. We instead replace
# `OllamaEmbedding.embed` with a drop-in that calls the MODERN
# `Client.embed(model, input, truncate=True, options={"num_ctx": …})` →
# `POST /api/embed`, which (verified live):
#   - HONORS `options.num_ctx` (raise the window to nomic's supported 8192, so
#     chunks up to ~8192 tokens embed with ZERO data loss — the 4,503-char
#     reddit chunk fits fully), and
#   - HONORS `truncate=True` (safety net: a genuinely huge >8192-token input is
#     truncated to the window instead of erroring — lossy only for pathological
#     inputs, but it NEVER 500s).
# `num_ctx` alone is insufficient (a 28k-char input still exceeds 8192 tokens →
# 400) and `truncate` alone keeps only 2048 tokens; combining both maximizes
# fidelity while guaranteeing no error. This mirrors the OpenCrow Qdrant path
# (`src/memory/embeddings.ts`), which already tolerates these same chunks because
# Ollama's OpenAI-compatible `/v1/embeddings` truncates by default.
#
# Patched at the CLASS level, so it applies identically to BOTH Memory instances
# (graph-on SIGE writes and graph-off agent-memory writes share the one embedder
# class) — SIGE's graph path is otherwise byte-identical. The output (a list of

# ─── Optional: disable hosted "reasoning"/thinking on the extraction LLM ───────
# Some hosted OpenAI-compatible models (e.g. Alibaba token-plan DeepSeek/Qwen and
# the OpenCode Go gateway) are *reasoning* models: they emit a hidden
# chain-of-thought that breaks mem0's always-on graph phase — the residual
# reasoning corrupts the nested relation tool-schema (relations come back empty)
# or, worse, the sequential tool-calling completions never return. Different
# gateways honour DIFFERENT disable flags, and an unknown flag is silently
# ignored, so we inject BOTH spellings:
#   - `enable_thinking: false`        (DashScope / Alibaba token-plan)
#   - `thinking: {"type": "disabled"}` (OpenCode Go gateway — verified the only
#                                       one it honours; enable_thinking is ignored)

# ─── Write-time relationship-type normalization (UPPERCASE canonical) ──────────
# mem0 0.1.118's graph write path LOWERCASES every extracted relationship before
# the Neo4j MERGE. In `mem0/memory/graph_memory.py`,
# `MemoryGraph._remove_spaces_from_entities` does (≈ line 612):
#
#     item["relationship"] = sanitize_relationship_for_cypher(
#         item["relationship"].lower().replace(" ", "_"))
#
# so every fresh graph edge lands lowercase (e.g. `complained_about`, `uses`,
# `available_on`). But the mem0↔Neo4j graph is meant to be canonicalized to
# UPPERCASE rel types: SIGE's REL_WHITELIST (src/sige/knowledge/neo4j-client.ts)
# is UPPERCASE-only. Canonicalization currently runs ONLY as a weekly launchd
# backfill (`ai.opencrow.canonicalize`, Sun 04:00, scripts/canonicalize-neo4j-
# graph.py) with NO write-time enforcement, so the graph re-drifts to lowercase
# within hours of each run.
#
# This patch enforces UPPERCASE AT WRITE so the graph is stored canonical at
# rest, the weekly --refine has a near-zero rel-type tail, and other graph
# consumers see canonical types. It complements (does not replace) the read-side
# case-insensitive fix in neo4j-client.ts (`toUpper(type(r)) IN $relWhitelist`,
# PR #247) — the two are defense-in-depth.
#
# Mechanism: wrap `sanitize_relationship_for_cypher` so its return value is
# upper-cased. Because line 612 calls it as the OUTERMOST transform building the
# final `item["relationship"]`, upper-casing its output guarantees every written
# rel type is UPPERCASE canonical:
#   "complained about" → .lower() → "complained_about"
#                      → sanitize → "complained_about"
#                      → .upper() → "COMPLAINED_ABOUT".
# Deterministic, NO LLM call, fail-safe.
#
# SCOPE: relationship TYPES only. Node/entity labels (e.g. `function`,
# `source_file`) are a SEPARATE axis — SIGE reads rels, not labels — and are left
# to the weekly canonicalizer; we do NOT touch them, nor the vector/embedder/LLM/
# Qdrant paths, the dual graph-on/graph-less design, or the response-shape
# helpers (`_normalize_relation`/`_flatten_relations`).
# Any char that is NOT a valid UNQUOTED Cypher identifier char. mem0 interpolates
# the relationship straight into `MERGE (s)-[r:{relationship}]->(d)` with NO
# backticks, so the rel type MUST be `[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*` or Neo4j raises a
# SyntaxError and the WHOLE graph write 500s. mem0's `sanitize_relationship_for_
# cypher` char-map misses some chars (notably `-` / ASCII `.`), so e.g. an
# extracted "Postgres-only" → `IS_POSTGRES-ONLY` → `[r:IS_POSTGRES-ONLY]` →
# `Invalid input '-'`. We coerce to a guaranteed-valid identifier as a backstop.
